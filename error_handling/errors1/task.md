This function refuses to generate text to be printed on a nametag if you pass it an empty string.
It'd be nicer if it explained what the problem was, instead of just sometimes returning `None`.
The 2nd test currently does not compile or pass, but it illustrates the behavior we would like this function to have.

<div class="hint">
  Hints can be added anywhere in task text: type "hint" and press Tab.
</div>
