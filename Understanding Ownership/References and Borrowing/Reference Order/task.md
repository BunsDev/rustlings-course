## Reference order

Make the code compile only by reordering the lines in `main()`, but without
adding, changing or removing any of them.

<div class="hint">
Carefully reason about the range in which each mutable reference is in
vogue. Does it help to update the value of referent (<code>x</code>) immediately after
the mutable reference is taken? Read more about 'Mutable References'
in the corresponding section in <a href="course://Understanding Ownership/Move Semantics/References and Borrowing">References and Borrowing</a>.
