## Return Values and Scope

Returning values can also transfer ownership. The code snippet below is an example with similar annotations to those in the previous snippet.

```rust
fn main() {
    let s1 = gives_ownership();         // gives_ownership moves its return
    // value into s1

    let s2 = String::from("hello");     // s2 comes into scope

    let s3 = takes_and_gives_back(s2);  // s2 is moved into
    // takes_and_gives_back, which also
    // moves its return value into s3
} // Here, s3 goes out of scope and is dropped. s2 goes out of scope but was
// moved, so nothing happens. s1 goes out of scope and is dropped.

fn gives_ownership() -> String {             // gives_ownership will move its
    // return value into the function
    // that calls it

    let some_string = String::from("hello"); // some_string comes into scope

    some_string                              // some_string is returned and
    // moves out to the calling
    // function
}

// takes_and_gives_back will take a String and return one
fn takes_and_gives_back(a_string: String) -> String { // a_string comes into
    // scope

    a_string  // a_string is returned and moves out to the calling function
}
```

##### Transferring ownership of return values

The ownership of a variable follows the same pattern every time: assigning a value to another variable moves it. When a variable that includes data on the heap goes out of scope, the value will be cleaned up by `drop` unless the data has been moved to be owned by another variable.

Taking ownership and then returning ownership with every function is a bit tedious. What if we want to let a function use a value but not take ownership? It’s quite annoying that anything we pass in also needs to be passed back if we want to use it again, in addition to any data resulting from the body of the function that we might want to return as well.

It’s possible to return multiple values using a tuple, as shown in the snippet below.

```rust
fn main() {
    let s1 = String::from("hello");

    let (s2, len) = calculate_length(s1);

    println!("The length of '{}' is {}.", s2, len);
}

fn calculate_length(s: String) -> (String, usize) {
    let length = s.len(); // len() returns the length of a String

    (s, length)
}
```

##### Returning ownership of parameters

But this is too much ceremony and a lot of work for a concept that should be common. Luckily for us, Rust has a feature for this concept, called _references_.

_You can refer to the following chapter in the Rust Programming Language Book: [Ownership](https://doc.rust-lang.org/stable/book/ch04-01-what-is-ownership.html)_
