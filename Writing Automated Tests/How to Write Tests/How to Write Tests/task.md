## How to Write Tests

Tests are Rust functions that verify that the non-test code is functioning in the expected manner. The bodies of test functions typically perform these three actions:

1.  Set up any needed data or state.
2.  Run the code you want to test.
3.  Assert the results are what you expect.

Letâ€™s look at the features Rust provides specifically for writing tests that take these actions, which include the `test` attribute, a few macros, and the `should_panic` attribute.


_You can refer to the following chapter in the Rust Programming Language Book: [Writing Tests](https://doc.rust-lang.org/stable/book/ch11-01-writing-tests.html)_
