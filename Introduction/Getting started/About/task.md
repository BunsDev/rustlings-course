Welcome to the Educational Products' adaptation of the exciting [rustlings](https://github.com/rust-lang/rustlings) course.

This course contains small exercises to get you used to reading and writing Rust code. This includes reading and responding to compiler messages!

The original materials were written by [Carol Nichols](https://github.com/carols10cents). The adaptation tries to stick with the initial spirit of the rustlings, while adding some hints about Rust development inside the IDE.

Alternatively, for a first-time Rust learner, there are several other resources:
* [The Book](The most comprehensive resource for learning Rust) - the most comprehensive resource for learning Rust, by Steve Klabnik and Carol Nichols, with contributions from the Rust Community. Along the course you will be provided with the links to the relevant chapters describing the concepts discussed in a more fundamental manner.

* [Rust By Example](https://doc.rust-lang.org/rust-by-example/index.html) - an online collection of runnable examples that illustrate various Rust concepts and standard libraries.
